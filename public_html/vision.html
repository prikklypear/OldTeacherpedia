    <h1>Welcome to Teacherpedia</h1>
    <p>Launched in September 2018, Teacherpedia is driven to make the lives of teachers easier.
    </p>
    <p>Our short term vision is to create inspiring, customisable resources that make creating resources easier than ever. All our resources will be customisable. Crucially however, our resources will be regenerative - that means that our resources can be regenerated with new questions time and time again.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>In the future, we will develop a unique system of planning lessons, using adaptive and customisable resources that can be tailored to your curriculum and subject needs.</p>
